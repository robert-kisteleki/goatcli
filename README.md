# goatcli - Go (RIPE) Atlas Tools - CLI

goatcli provides a CLI to interact with [RIPE Atlas](https://atlas.ripe.net/) [APIs](https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/) using [Golang](https://go.dev/). It uses the [goatapi](https://github.com/robert-kisteleki/goatapi/) under the hood. It is similar to [Magellan](https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/ripe-atlas-tools).

It supports:
* finding probes, anchors and measurements
* scheduling new measurements and immediately show its results
* stopping existing measurements
* modify participants of an existing measurement (add/remove probes)
* downloading and displaying results of measurements
* tuning in to result streaming
* loading a local file containing measurement results
* various kinds of output formatters for displaying and aggregating measurement results

The tool needs Go 1.21 to compile.

# Context

[RIPE Atlas](https://atlas.ripe.net) is an open, community based active Internet
measurement network developed by the [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net/) since 2010.
It provides a number of vantage points ("probes") run by volunteers, that allow
various kinds of network measurements (pings, traceroutes, DNS queries, ...) to
be run by any user.
